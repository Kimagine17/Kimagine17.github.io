I am a first year PhD student in the Kalhert School of Computing at the University of Utah. My advisor is Professor Mary Hall, and I am interested in High Performance Computing and Compiler Optimization. I graduated from Brigham Young University April, 2025 with a BS in Comuter Science with a Mathmatics minor.  

## Research Interests
High-performance computing • Compilers • Scientific computing  
Functional programming • Algorithms and theory

## Experience
**Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL): 2019 – 2025**  
Worked on streaming decision trees, memory optimization, HPC simulation with SST, accuracy profiling, and hyper-parameter tuning with Optuna. Presented research at the IEEE WIE Leadership Summit 2024.

**Research Assistant — Brigham Young University: 2024 – 2025**  
Implemented a fixed-point parsing framework, explored partial evaluation for performance improvement, and studied functional programming concepts such as monads.

**Teaching Assistant — CS 236 (Discrete Structures): 2024**  
Taught grammars, parsing, proofs, sets, relations, graph algorithms, and debugging; graded assignments.
