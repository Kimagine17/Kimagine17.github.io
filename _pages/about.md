I am a first year PhD student in the Kalhert School of Computing at the University of Utah. My advisor is Professor Mary Hall, and I am interested in High Performance Computing and Compiler Optimization. I graduated from Brigham Young University April, 2025 with a BS in Comuter Science with a Mathmatics minor.
